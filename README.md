<h1 align="center">Welcome to RadChain Connect!</h1>

## RadChain Connect aims to develop a solution that integrates blockchain technology with FreeRADIUS, in addition to incorporating the use of self-sovereign identity and passkeys.

### To test RadChain Connect, you must:

1. Install and open the [Ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/) test blockchain.
2. open your project in an IDE of your choice (we use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)).
  
3. In the project directory, type the commands (open a terminal):
   ```
   truffle init 

4. Configure the truffle-config.js file.

5.  In the project directory, type the commands (open a terminal):

6.  ```
    truffle compile
    truffle deploy

7. Configure the **index.html** and **login.html** files with the compiled contract *address* (found in Ganache > Contracts) and *ABI* (found in build/contracts > UniversityDegree.json).

8. Project is ready to run (you can install the VSCode **Live Server** extension to run the project).
